## WooCommerce Product Table vs woocommerce product grid layout
*Tables help connect customers to desired products much faster and more surely that grids*

See [[this example](https://wcproducttable.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-05-29_11-05-37.png)] of table vs grid presentation of the same catalog. You will note that:

* A table view offers a far more quick bird’s eye view of the products than a grid layout. The information is easier to absorb in table format.
* Tables allow customers to quickly sort and compare along columns which helps with easier judgement and decision making.
* This leads to better chance of landing a sale with the table UI. Also an advantage over competitors.
* A table view of products can also *supplement* a grid view where appropriate. 
* WooCommerce Product Table PRO also has an [addon to create grid layout and provide view switcher](https://pro.wcproducttable.com/downloads/grid-table-view-switcher/) so shoppers can select table or grid view for products

## Display product variations in woocommerce product table
* The Lite version of the plugin offers a popup form to select product variations when a user tried to add a variable product to cart. 
* The PRO version of the plugin offers a ‘Select variation’ element that can display variation option in dropdown or radio buttons inside the table anywhere you choose [[see documentation](https://wcproducttable.com/documentation/select-variation)]
* The PRO version of the plugin also offers a ‘Cart form’ element which displays the product variation form within the table wherever you choose.

## Product add-ons / product extra options
WooCommerce Product Table PRO supports the official [[WooCommerce Product Addons](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-add-ons/?aff=16345)] plugin. This is the only supported product add on plugin right now.

## Wholesale / Request a quote / Min-Max price
* PRO version is compatible with several 3rd party plugins that offer such facilities [[see list](https://wcproducttable.notion.site/wcproducttable/List-of-3rd-party-plugins-compatible-with-WCPT-PRO-b6138e2590684cf49a198beb292aa3c1)]
* In case a popular plugin you need to use is not compatible, please [[contact support](https://wcproducttable.com/support)]

## Translation
* Both WooCommerce Product Table Lite and PRO can be used in any language. You can change each word in the table to your language using the table editor and the plugin's settings. No translation software is required for this. See [plugin FAQs](https://www.notion.so/wcproducttable/FAQs-f624e13d0d274a08ba176a98d6d79e1f) > styling > How do I change any text in the product table? For example in the buttons, headings, filters and sorting options?
* But if you need to provide 'multiple' language translations for your your site then you can use the PRO version of this plugin which is compatible with the [WPML](https://wpml.org/?aid=251669&affiliate_key=FYus30fNppF7) translation plugin. 
* For non-WooCommerce related text in your product table use [wcpt_translate default=“text” en_US=“English text” fr_FR=“French text”] in the input fields to add as many translations as you want.

## Replace shop grid with table
* You can replace the woocommerce archive page product grids with tables using the PRO version's [archive Override facility](https://wcproducttable.com/documentation/enable-archive-override). Replace default WooCommerce grids with product tables on all/any product archive pages — shop, category, tag, attribute, search. The facility is located in WP Dashboard > Product Tables > Settings > Replace shop product grid with table.
* If you are using popupar theme builder plugin like Elementor, Divi, Bricks, Visual Composer, Oxygen, Beaver Builder, etc then use the [Archive override guide for theme builders](https://wcproducttable.com/documentation/elementor-woocommerce-product-table). Just place shortcode [wcpt_archive_table] in your templates.


== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce Product Table Lite, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WooCommerce Product Table” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I replace my default WooCommerce shop grid with a product table? =

Use the [Archive Override](https://wcproducttable.com/documentation/enable-archive-override) facility available in WooCommerce Product Table PRO (premium version). This facility lets you conveniently replace default WooCommerce grids with product tables on all your product archive pages — shop, category, tag, attribute, search. The facility is located in WP Dashboard > Product Tables > Settings > Archive Override.

= How do I create a new table? =

You can find full step-by-step tutorials on creating different kinds of tables along with video and annotated screenshots at the [WooCommerce Product Table tutorial](https://wcproducttable.com/tutorials/) page. The process is simple and convenient. Absolutely anyone can follow along with the tutorials.

If you have any issue at all in creating your product table, please feel free to reach out for [support](https://wcproducttable.com/support/) and I will bet happy to help!

= Do I have to setup separate columns for laptop, tablet and phone? =

Only Laptop Columns are 'required'. Tablet and Phone Columns are completely optional. Using the Tablet and Phone Columns you can fine-tune the table design for smaller devices. If you leave the tablet / phone columns empty then the plugin will simply use the laptop columns for the smaller devices as well.
